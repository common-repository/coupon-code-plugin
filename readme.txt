Provide coupon codes that can not be copied without the user visiting your affiliate link. Protect your income.

== Description ==

Providing coupon codes is an excellent way to increase your affiliate earnings, but many users bypass your affiliate link and still use the coupon you provide to receive a discount on their purchase. This has been a common problem for all affiliates for a long time.

*Coupon Code Plugin solves this for you.*

**Coupon Code Plugin will do the following:**

1. Mask your affiliate links (optional).
2. Secures your affiliate income.
3. Displays coupon codes in a way that can not be copied without visiting your affiliate link.
4. Provides *call to action* popups so that the user is instructed to click on the coupon code to copy it.

**How does it work?**

1. User can see the coupon code, but it is disaplayed as an image and not as text.
2. The user can not highlight or copy the coupon code.
3. When the user clicks on the coupon code, it takes the user to the affiliate link for that coupon and it copies the coupon code to the users clipboard so that they can paste it into the checkout to receive the discount.

Coupon Code Plugin allows you to quickly and easily add stylized coupon codes to your Posts and Pages in WordPress in a way that will prevent lost commissions and boost your conversions.

Your affiliate links are protected to ensure you do not lose any earnings from visitors simply copying your coupon code and going to the merchants website on their own, which would bypass your affiliate code and lose you commission. Instead, when a visitor clicks on a coupon code, the code is copied to their clipboard, ready for them to paste it into the merchants website. At the same time, the visitor is sent to the merchant using your affiliate link. Even if the visitor does not make a purchase now, the merchant will have tagged the visitor as being referred by your affiliate account. When the visitor goes back to the merchant and makes their purchase, you will receive the commission for the sale.
